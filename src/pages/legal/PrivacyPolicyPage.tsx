        <p>At MMortal Ltd., your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share your personal information through our website (www.mindmortal.com) and related services. Your use of MMORTAL is also governed by our Terms of Use, which incorporate this Privacy Policy. Any undefined terms used here have the same meaning as in the Terms of Use.</p>
        
        <p>This policy outlines what personal information we collect, how we use and share that information, your choices and rights regarding your data, and how we protect it. It applies whenever you interact with MMORTAL, whether through browsing, account creation, uploading content, or making a purchase.</p>
        
        <p>We collect personal information in two main ways: information you provide to us directly and information we collect automatically. You may share data when you create an account, upload a legacy, share an idea, or send a message. This includes your name, email, photos, videos, written stories, billing details, subscription preferences, and any other information you submit. Automatically, we may collect details like your IP address, browser, device type, usage patterns, and interaction history using cookies and similar tracking tools.</p>
        
        <p>We use your data to help you manage your account, legacy entries, messages, and ideas. It enables mentor matching, notifications, and improvements to our platform experience. We collect data only when we have a lawful reasonâ€”such as your consent, the need to deliver a service you've requested, or legal compliance.</p>
        
        <p>We do not sell your data. However, we may share it with MMORTAL affiliates, mentors (if you've subscribed to their content), and service providers who assist in operating our platform, such as payment processors, hosting services, and analytics tools. If you use an integrated platform like YouTube, your data will also be governed by that third party's privacy policy. In the case of mergers, acquisitions, or legal requests, your data may be shared or transferred. We may also use anonymized data for research or platform improvement.</p>
        
        <p>Cookies help us remember your preferences, keep you logged in, and improve platform usage understanding. You can disable them in your browser, but some platform features may be limited as a result.</p>
        
        <p>We retain your data for as long as your account is active or necessary to provide services. If you delete your account, we will remove your data unless it's required for legal or operational purposes.</p>
        
        <p>We take steps to secure your data using encryption, access controls, and secure infrastructure. Your MMORTAL account is password-protected, and you are responsible for protecting your credentials. While we strive to keep your information safe, no system is entirely immune to risk.</p>
        
        <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or transfer your personal data, or to withdraw consent for its use. To exercise any of these rights, contact us at privacy@mindmortal.com and we will respond as required by applicable law.</p>
        
        <p>We may update this policy from time to time. When we do, the revised date will be posted here. If changes are significant, we may notify you directly through email or the platform. Continued use of MMORTAL means you accept the updated terms.</p>
        
        <p>If you have any questions about this policy or your personal data, contact us at privacy@mindmortal.com or by mail at MMortal Ltd., Melbourne Street, Garth Heads, Newcastle NE1 2JE, United Kingdom.</p>
