        <p>MMORTAL is a platform for preserving human value through legacy, mentorship, and innovation. We host and protect the stories, ideas, and wisdom of individuals across generations and cultures. These Community Guidelines define what is and isn't acceptable on MMORTAL. By participating in the platform, you agree to follow these standards as part of our shared responsibility in creating a meaningful and respectful space.</p>
        
        <p>We reserve the exclusive right to interpret and enforce these guidelines. In doing so, we may consult legal advisors, community feedback, historical context, and evolving best practices in digital safety and ethics. If you encounter content that may breach these guidelines or have questions about how they're applied, please contact us at contact@mindmortal.com. If content violates these guidelines, we may remove it, restrict its visibility, issue warnings, or suspend accounts. These guidelines may be updated over time to reflect the growth and evolving needs of our community.</p>
        
        <p>These guidelines apply to all content submitted, uploaded, transmitted, or otherwise made available by users on MMORTAL. This includes public and private posts, comments, multimedia, mentorship sessions, time-locked messages, and profile information. Our goal is to foster thoughtful contribution and constructive participation.</p>
        
        <p>Users must not engage in hate speech or discriminatory practices, including content that promotes or condones violence, harassment, or discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or age. Harassment, abuse, or threats including doxing or stalking are strictly prohibited. Users may not distribute misinformation, especially regarding health, science, or history, nor plagiarize or misuse others' content without proper rights or attribution.</p>
        
        <p>MMORTAL is not a platform for adult content, graphic violence, or gratuitous suffering. We have a strict no-nudity policy for profile images and prohibit sexually exploitative content. While sensitive personal stories are welcomed, they must be shared with dignity, purpose, and content warnings. Explicit content may be restricted from public visibility or removed entirely.</p>
        
        <p>Users may not exploit the platform for spam or scams. This includes deceptive links, unsolicited promotional material, fraudulent fundraising campaigns, or requests for money or data under false pretenses. Our community should be free from exploitation and manipulation of trust.</p>
        
        <p>Mentors and advisors must uphold high professional standards. This includes respecting mentee boundaries, avoiding coercive or unqualified advice, maintaining confidentiality, and refraining from promoting personal businesses unless explicitly requested. All mentorship must be grounded in good faith and constructive intent.</p>
        
        <p>Respectful participation is expected in all public and private interactions. Users should engage in good faith, particularly in mentorship sessions and collaborative spaces like the Idea Vault. Commentary should remain constructive and appropriate in tone, including in messages meant for future release. Trolling, derailing conversations, or toxic behavior is not tolerated.</p>
        
        <p>MMORTAL may take enforcement actions at its sole discretion, including content removal, account suspension, limiting access to platform features, or notifying legal authorities. Our moderation decisions are guided by our Terms of Use and legal obligations, including the UK Online Safety Act, the EU Digital Services Act, and U.S. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.</p>
        
        <p>Users can appeal moderation decisions by writing to support@mindmortal.com within 14 days of the notice. Reports of violations can be submitted through in-platform tools or by email. Every report is reviewed with confidentiality and respect for fairness.</p>
        
        <p>We may update these guidelines as our platform evolves. Changes will be reflected on this page with a revised effective date. Continued use of MMORTAL after updates go into effect implies your acceptance of the revised Community Guidelines.</p>
