      "description": "Mandela didn't just fight apartheid—he documented his journey through prison, pain, and peace. His letters, preserved during incarceration, became timeless guidance for generations. If Mandela had MMortal, his story wouldn't just be found in books—it would live within an interactive vault, ready for all. Lesson: It's not the title you hold, but the story you leave behind."

      "description": "Jamir, a 78-year-old carpenter in Bangladesh, had no formal education but built homes for three generations. When asked what he was most proud of, he said: 'Knowing how to fix what others thought was broken.' He never wrote anything down. After he passed, his grandkids only knew he 'worked with wood.' His philosophy, techniques, and way of looking at life—all lost."
